# Lesson 4: Functions and modules

For the fourth lesson we will learn how to create and use functions, one of the most useful concepts in programming.
We will also introduce you to the concept of library (referred often as a module in Python), which you can think of as a toolbox for a specific purpose.
Each library contains specific functionalities (i.e., functions) that you can use for different tasks.
Thus functions and libraries are closely related concepts.
